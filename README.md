#Description: The `converted` folder is created dynamically in the `convert` function when the user selects a conversion format. If the selected format is not supported by PIL (Python Imaging Library), the image is converted using OpenCV instead. The converted image is saved to the `converted` folder with the selected format and a unique name based on the original image name.

The `preview` function is used to preview the selected image in a pop-up window. It resizes the image to a fixed size, converts it to the selected format, and saves it to a temporary file. The temporary file is then displayed in the pop-up window using JavaScript.

The `handle_form_submission` function is used to handle the form submission when the user clicks the "Convert" button. It gets the selected image, conversion format, and dimensions from the form, converts the image using the `convert` function, and returns the output path. The preview image is also updated with the converted image.

The `handle_preview_image` function is used to preview the selected image in a preview window. It gets the selected image, converts it to the selected format, and saves it to a temporary file. The temporary file is then displayed in the preview window using JavaScript.

The `handle_popup_window_preview` function is used to preview the selected image in a pop-up window when the user clicks the preview image. It gets the selected image and conversion format from the preview image, converts the image using the `convert` function, and saves it to a temporary file. The temporary file is then displayed in the pop-up window using JavaScript.

The `index.js` file is used to add event listeners to the form, preview image, and preview window. It prevents the form from submitting and sends a POST request to the server to convert the image. It also adds event listeners to the preview image and preview window to preview the selected image and convert it to the selected format.

The `pop-up_output_window.js` file is used to close the pop-up window when the user clicks the close button. It adds an event listener to the `window.onbeforeunload` property to display a confirmation message when the user tries to close the window.

The `README.md` file is used to provide documentation and instructions for the user. It explains how to use the application and provides information about the supported conversion formats and dimensions.

The `requirements.txt` file is used to list the required Python libraries and versions for the application. It ensures that the application can be installed and run on different systems and environments.
